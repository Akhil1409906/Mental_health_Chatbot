📄 Abstract
Mental health is a crucial aspect of human well-being, yet many face barriers when seeking help, especially regarding accessibility and timely support. This project presents an AI-powered mental health chatbot designed to provide confidential, immediate, and personalized support using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques. The chatbot simulates human-like conversations, offering guidance on mental health concerns like anxiety, depression, and stress, while ensuring empathetic and meaningful interactions.
